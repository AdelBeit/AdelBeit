I'm Adele and I'm a problem solver. With a drive for exploration, a fistful of curiosity, and a pocketful of ideas! I love coding for its low cost of entry and lightning fast iterative loop, but I also like to fiddle with other creative outlets such as; electronics, cooking, music, photography, and design.


Also I'm an aspiring robot and strive for maximum efficiency; I LOVE keyboard shortcuts. Try pressing ctrl + k on any github page (command + k on macs), or try ctrl + d 

By the way, I have code if you have <img align="bottom" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8835499/218330542-44214625-5d5c-495c-a4a0-b1e033ff95a9.png" width="20px" height="20px"/>
