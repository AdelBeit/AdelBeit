# Welcome Traveler

I'm Adele and I'm a problem solver, I enjoy building and tinkering with things. Coding is my favorite medium, but I also like to experiment with other mediums such as cooking, music, photography, and design.

Aside from creating things, I also love exploring new things! Be it trying out new foods, discovering new music, finding new tv shows, traveling to new places, meeting new people, or trying new hobbies.

I'm a lifelong learner who's passionate about creating and exploring; Perpetually looking for new opportunities to better myself and the world around me!

By the way, I have code if you have<img align="bottom" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8835499/218330542-44214625-5d5c-495c-a4a0-b1e033ff95a9.png" width="30px" height="30px"/>
